# Project description: gift-giving app
This app is supposed to help people buy presents for their loved ones.
It lets the users save cool gift ideas, browse through them and assign in advance future gifts for their friends and family, so that when the next gift-giving occasion comes they don't find themselves in the stressing situation of having to think of something last-minute.
To make things easier it notifies users of upcoming birthdays and help prevent giving somebody the same gift twice (happens all the time).
Someday it will do a lot more things, hopefully.


## We're I'm at
I'm reworking throught absolutely everything, so not much is working at the moment. A little patience :)
So far what we *can* actually do is:
1) Create and remove users, gifts and events
2) USER: add and remove friends on a user profile page
3) USER: save and discard gift ideas
All working post instructions are printed to the browser console in user/all, gift/all, event/all URLs, as well as in the individual user/:id URLs
