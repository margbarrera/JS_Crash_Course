It lets the users save cool gift ideas, browse through them and plan in advance future gifts for their friends and family, so that they don't find themselves in the stressing situation of having to think of something last-minute. To make things easier it notifies users of upcoming birthdays and help prevent giving somebody the same gift twice (happens all the time). Someday it will do a lot more things, hopefully.",
